                    The giant panda, also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.
                    It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
                    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. 
                    Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
                    Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
                    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
                    As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.

                While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role.
                As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.
